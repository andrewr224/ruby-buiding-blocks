## Project 1: Caesar Cipher
Task: Implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string.

Load cipher.rb, use caesar_cipher(message, number_of_modifications) to try it

## Project 2: Stock Picker
Task: Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.

## Project 3: Substrings
Task: Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.
